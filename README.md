# Google Play Store Market Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a market research project focused on the Google Play Store. The dataset used includes 2.3 million applications from the Play Store, representing a comprehensive snapshot of the market at the time of data collection. The goal of this project is to answer key marketing-related questions posed by a group of investors.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Category Distribution**: Determine the number of apps per category on the Google Play Store.
2. **Top App Publishers**: Identify the top 100 companies with the most apps on the Play Store. The company is identified in the App ID column, where the first two words in the package represent their domain (e.g., Google => `com.google`, Apple => `com.apple`).
3. **Independent Developers**: Find the top 3 developers with the most applications developed who do not work for the company that released the app, based on the Developer Email column.
4. **App Purchasing Power**: Calculate the number of apps that can be purchased with $1000 and $10,000, starting with the most expensive apps first.
5. **Download Statistics**: Compare the total number of downloads for free apps versus paid apps.
